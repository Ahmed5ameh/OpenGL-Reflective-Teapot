# OpenGL-Reflective-Teapot
In this project, I did the following:
1- Created the Skybox
2- Added diffuse, ambient and specular for 1 directional light
3- Added colour and specular values from maps
4- Reflected the skybox on the shiny (specular) part of the teapot
I didn't use normal maps (as it is heavy on math)
